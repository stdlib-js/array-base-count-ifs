    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

## Usage

```javascript
import countIfs from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-base-count-ifs@esm/index.mjs';
```

#### countIfs( x0, predicate0\[, x1, predicate1\[, x2, predicate2\[, ...args]]] )

Performs element-wise evaluation of one or more input arrays according to provided predicate functions and counts the number of elements for which all predicates respectively return `true`.

```javascript
function predicate0( value ) {
    return ( value > 0 );
}

function predicate1( value ) {
    return ( value < 3 );
}

var x0 = [ 0, 1, 0, 1, 2 ];
var x1 = [ 2, 3, 1, 2, 5 ];

var out = countIfs( x0, predicate0, x1, predicate1 );
// returns 1
```

The function has the following parameters:

-   **x0**: first input array.
-   **predicate0**: first predicate function.
-   **x1**: second input array (_optional_).
-   **predicate1**: second predicate function (_optional_).
-   **x2**: third input array (_optional_).
-   **predicate2**: third predicate function (_optional_).
-   **args**: additional input arrays and corresponding predicate functions (_optional_).

Each predicate function is provided three arguments:

-   **value**: current array element.
-   **index**: current array element index.
-   **arr**: the corresponding input array.

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   The function assumes that all input arrays have the same length.
-   The function supports array-like objects supporting the accessor protocol (e.g., [`Complex128Array`][@stdlib/array/complex128], [`Complex64Array`][@stdlib/array/complex64], etc).
