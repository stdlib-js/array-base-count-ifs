    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

## Installation

```bash
npm install @stdlib/array-base-count-ifs
```

Alternatively,

-   To load the package in a website via a `script` tag without installation and bundlers, use the [ES Module][es-module] available on the [`esm`][esm-url] branch (see [README][esm-readme]).
-   If you are using Deno, visit the [`deno`][deno-url] branch (see [README][deno-readme] for usage intructions).
-   For use in Observable, or in browser/node environments, use the [Universal Module Definition (UMD)][umd] build available on the [`umd`][umd-url] branch (see [README][umd-readme]).

The [branches.md][branches-url] file summarizes the available branches and displays a diagram illustrating their relationships.

To view installation and usage instructions specific to each branch build, be sure to explicitly navigate to the respective README files on each branch, as linked to above.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var countIfs = require( '@stdlib/array-base-count-ifs' );
```

#### countIfs( x0, predicate0\[, x1, predicate1\[, x2, predicate2\[, ...args]] )

Performs element-wise evaluation of one or more input arrays according to provided predicate functions and counts the number of elements for which all predicates respectively return `true`.

```javascript
function predicate0( value ) {
    return ( value > 0 );
}

function predicate1( value ) {
    return ( value < 3 );
}

var x0 = [ 0, 1, 0, 1, 2 ];
var x1 = [ 2, 3, 1, 2, 5 ];

var out = countIfs( x0, predicate0, x1, predicate1 );
// returns 1
```

The function has the following parameters:

-   **x0**: first input array.
-   **predicate0**: first predicate function.
-   **x1**: second input array (_optional_).
-   **predicate1**: second predicate function (_optional_).
-   **x2**: third input array (_optional_).
-   **predicate2**: third predicate function (_optional_).
-   **args**: additional input arrays and corresponding predicate functions (_optional_).

Each predicate function is provided three arguments:

-   **value**: current array element.
-   **index**: current array element index.
-   **arr**: the corresponding input array.

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   The function assumes that all input arrays have the same length.
-   The function supports array-like objects supporting the accessor protocol (e.g., [`Complex128Array`][@stdlib/array/complex128], [`Complex64Array`][@stdlib/array/complex64], etc).

var discreteUniform = require( '@stdlib/random-array-discrete-uniform' );
var isPositiveInteger = require( '@stdlib/assert-is-positive-integer' ).isPrimitive;

var naryFunction = require( '@stdlib/utils-nary-function' );
var countIfs = require( '@stdlib/array-base-count-ifs' );

var x = discreteUniform( 10, -5, 5, {
    'dtype': 'int32'
});
console.log( x );

var y = discreteUniform( 10, -5, 5, {
    'dtype': 'int32'
});
console.log( y );

var out = countIfs( x, naryFunction( isPositiveInteger, 1 ), y, naryFunction( isNegativeInteger, 1 ) );
